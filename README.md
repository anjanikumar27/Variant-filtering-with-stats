# Variant-filtering-with-stats
A Python workflow for filtering variants from a VCF file based on quality (QUAL), read depth (DP), and allele frequency (AF). The script generates a new, filtered VCF file and a detailed log file containing summary statistics and a per-chromosome breakdown of filtered variants.
